# webp2common

## Notice

Thank you to everyone who used this shell script; I was inspired to create a [webapp for converting webp and svg to png and gif](https://github.com/Thysbelon/WebpSvg2common). I hope it will be useful.

An ImageMagick batch/bash script that detects if a webp is animated or static and converts it to gif or png.

Windows users should use the .bat file. Everyone else should use the .bash file.

To download, click on the appropriate webp2common script, hold down `alt` and click "raw". On Firefox, this shortcut has to be enabled by navigating to `about:config` in the address bar at the top, then search for browser.altClickSave and click the arrows â®‚ button to set it to `true`.

On mobile: tap and hold "view raw", then tap "Download link"

In a Termux terminal, run the bash script by typing "bash webp2common.bash"
